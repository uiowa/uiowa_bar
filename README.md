## Introduction

The UI Branding Bar provides a top 40 pixel bar to your
Drupal website. These sections are not blocks, they are rendered directly to the
top region of your site.

The module has been built to be compatibile with all modern browsers, as well as older versions of Internet Explorer.


## Installation and configuration

Enable the module as usual.

The module provides a default light theme for the bar and footer. If you wish to
change the palette to the dark theme, navigate to
admin/config/user-interface/uiowa-bar

## FAQs

### Why have the custom links if you are looking for consistency? 

Many sites previously used some of the branding bar space for call to action links or links back to their original unit. This function still allows these options, but presented in a consistent way across all sites.

### Why are the custom links hidden on mobile?

This was done to save real estate on mobile display.

### Where is the global footer?

This was removed as it was more confusing to users than helpful.

### The global footer provided the copyright, do I need that on my site?

All information on a web site is automatically copyrighted, so you do not need to have it on your site. If you would like it, feel free to include it in your site footer.

### Will websites also be required to use a standard favicon/touch icons?

While not mentioned specifically in the brand manual, it is encouraged to use the gold dome on a black background as outlined in the social media section. There is a [Drupal module](https://github.com/ITS-UofIowa/uiowa_favicon) available which can put this in place for you.
