## FAQs

### Why have the custom links if you are looking for consistency? 

Many sites previously used some of the branding bar space for call to action links or links back to their original unit. This function still allows these options, but presented in a consistent way across all sites.

### Where is the global footer?

This was removed as it was more confusing to users than helpful.

### The global footer provided the copyright, do I need that on my site?

All information on a web site is automatically copyrighted, so you do not need to have it on your site. If you would like it, feel free to include it in your site footer.

### The global footer provided a link to the privacy statement, do I need that on my site?

The privacy statement linked off the home page covers all sites under uiowa.edu, however you may consider adding it to your site footer as well.

### What is the tag manager code?

This module adds a Google Tag Manager code to the site that is managed at the University level. This allows for tracking traffic across all sites using this module. It is meant to handle the situation where a site did not install Google Analytics and needs information about their site, however it may also be used to gather data about how traffic flows across the University web sites.

The Google Analytics within the Google Tag Manager container should not impact any site specific Google Analytics code if properly implemented.
