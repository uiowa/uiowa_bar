Introduction
==================
The UIowa Branding Bar provides a top 40 pixel bar and bottom footer to your
Drupal website. These sections are not blocks, they are rendered directly to the
top and bottom regions of your site.

The module has been built mobile first. It progressively enhances for larger
screens and for browsers where javascript is available.

The module has been tested to be
functional with older versions of Internet Explorer, but it may not appear the
same as modern browsers.

Installation and configuration
==================
Enable the module as usual.

The module provides a default light theme for the bar and footer. If you wish to
change the palette to the dark theme, navigate to
admin/config/user-interface/uiowa-bar
